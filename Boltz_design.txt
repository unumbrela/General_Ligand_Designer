BOLTZDESIGN1: INVERTING ALL-ATOM STRUCTURE
PREDICTION MODEL FOR GENERALIZED BIOMOLECULAR

BINDER DESIGN


ABSTRACT
Deep learning in structure prediction has revolutionized protein research, enabling large-scale screen-
ing, novel hypothesis generation, and accelerated experimental design across biological domains.
Recent advances, including RoseTTAFold-AA and AlphaFold3, have extended structure prediction
models to work with small molecules, nucleic acids, ions, and covalent modifications. We present
BoltzDesign1, which inverts the Boltz-1 model, an open source reproduction of AlphaFold3, to
enable the design of protein binders for diverse molecular targets without requiring model fine-
tuning. By utilizing only the Pairformer and Confidence modules, our method significantly reduces
computational costs while achieving outstanding in silico success rates and diversity in binder genera-
tion. Optimizing directly on the distogram allows us to shape the probability distribution of atomic
distances, rather than adjusting a single structure, steering the design toward sequences that yield
robust structures with well-defined energy minima. By leveraging a fully atomic model trained on
a wide variety of macromolecules, we can generate diverse heterocomplexes with flexible ligand
conformations—a capability not currently matched by existing methods. This approach enables the
design of novel protein interactions with potential applications in biosensors, enzyme engineering,
therapeutic development, and biotechnological innovations.

1 Introduction

Designing protein binders that specifically interact with molecular targets to mediate functions such as catalytic activity,
molecular recognition, structural support, and protein–biomolecule interactions is a critical goal in both synthetic
biology and therapeutic development [1, 2, 3]. With the recent development of deep learning-based computational
methods, the success rate of protein design has increased, helping to facilitate designs that can be experimentally
validated with minimal screening [4, 5]. Several approaches have emerged for protein design, especially converting
structure prediction models into generative models. One strategy is fine-tuning structure prediction models as diffusion
models to generate novel structures, exemplified by RfDiffusion[6] and RfDiffusionAA[7]. The alternative strategy
employs existing models without additional training by applying backpropagation to iteratively refine sequences until
achieving high model confidence scores. This approach, originally termed "hallucination" in the context of trRosetta [8]
and later extended to AlphaFold2 [9], has been successfully applied across multiple domains, including fixed-backbone
design, binder design, and peptide design [10, 11, 12]. The backpropagation approach offers several significant
advantages: it eliminates the requirement for model retraining while permitting optimization based on customized loss
functions, such as helical content or radius of gyration. Additionally, it enables modeling of sequence and structure with
the unique capability of joint structure prediction of ligand and binder during design, thereby enabling the exploration
of induced fit effects upon binding, a feature not currently accessible through computational methods.








BindCraft [10] exemplifies this methodology by utilizing the AlphaFold2 model to generate protein binders through
iterative sequence and structure optimization. AlphaFold2 comprises an Evoformer and a structure module, allowing
loss to propagate through the entire model to the input. Beginning with relaxed sequence space [13], optimization
proceeds toward one-hot encoded sequences, allowing the model to explore solutions that effectively minimize the
loss compared to direct one-hot encoded optimization. It leverages output metrics, including confidence scores such as
pLDDT and pAE values, and iteratively applies gradients to input sequence until a confident structure is predicted. This
approach fully exploits the existing model with various customizable optimization loss functions. For instance, helix
loss can modulate the percentage of helices and beta sheets during design to increase structural diversity, while radius
of gyration (Rg) loss can regulate the compactness of designed structures.
With the advent of AlphaFold3 (AF3) [14] and RoseTTAFold-All-Atom[7], prediction capabilities now extend beyond
protein structures to include small molecules, ions, nucleic acids, and post-translational modifications, such as phospho-
rylation or glycosylation. Since its release, AlphaFold3 has inspired the development of several comparable models,
including Boltz-1 [15] Chai-1 [16], Protenix [17], and HelixFold3 [18]. However, a key distinction between AF2 and
AF3-like models is that AF3 models incorporate diffusion modules for structure prediction after processing through
MSA and Pairformer modules. Backpropagating through the 200 steps of the diffusion model is computationally
expensive, requires substantial memory, is likely to lead to vanishing-gradient issues, and represents only a single
sample from the probability distribution of the pair features.
Here, we introduce BoltzDesign1, a framework that enables hallucination through Boltz-1, an all-atom prediction
model (Figure 1A), by directly optimizing the probability distribution of the pair features via predicted distrogram.
Rather than utilizing the complete model, we employ only the Pairformer and Confidence modules to design proteins
applicable to diverse biomolecular applications. As an initial demonstration, we benchmark against small molecules
tested in RfDiffusionAA and design binders. BoltzDesign1-generated binders exhibit higher in silico success rates and
greater structural diversity compared to RfDiffusionAA. We further show that our approach can be used to design metal
binders, nucleic acid binders, and post-translationally modified proteins. Due to the nature of the model simultaneously
predicting both binder and ligand, we can uniquely account for flexible ligand modeling—unlike existing methods,
where ligands remain fixed. This ability is especially useful when the ligand conformation is unknown or unavailable in
the PDB. These advancements will greatly expand our capabilities in designing proteins with more complex folds and
functionalities, interacting with a wide range of biologically relevant molecules.

2 Method

The distogram from Pairformer effectively represents the probability distribution of atomic distances that the diffusion
model later samples from. By directly optimizing this underlying distribution rather than individual sampled structures,
we can achieve more efficient exploration of the sequence-structure landscape while avoiding the computational burden
of backpropagating through numerous diffusion steps. Our protein design framework employs two approaches. The
simplest method utilizes only the Pairformer to optimize sequences by backpropagating through the distogram loss. A
more advanced method incorporates a Confidence module alongside the Pairformer, enabling joint optimization using
both distogram loss and confidence scores. We reason that the confidence module represents the fit between the sampled
structure from the diffusion module and the probability distribution of the pair features. In some cases, such as the
protein-DNA/RNA interactions, where pair features are ambiguous, additional sampling within the diffusion module
may better assess the accessible structural space.
To enable backpropagation of the loss from the confidence module to the input, we modify the process to allow gradient
flow between the Pairformer and the Confidence module. Specifically, we apply a stop-gradient operation to the
Diffusion Module to prevent gradients from flowing through diffusion steps.

ŝtrunk, ẑtrunk = Pairformer Trunk(strunk, ztrunk, Sinput)
xyzatom = Structure Module(ŝtrunk, ẑtrunk).stop_gradient (1)

Confidence score = Confidence Module(ŝtrunk, ẑtrunk,xyzatom, Sinput)

where si represents the single-sequence representation, zij denotes the pairwise representation, and Sinput is the initial
sequence input. xyzatom corresponds to the denoised 3D structure coordinates. Here, ŝtrunk and ẑtrunk are the outputs
from the Pairformer, where gradients are allowed to flow through to the confidence module.
The confidence module receives structure coordinates, updated ŝtrunk and ẑtrunk from the Pairformer, but it is initialized
with a new representation predicted by the confidence module’s Atom Attention Encoder and MSA module, using the
same Sinput. In our approach, we backpropagate the confidence loss through the Pairformer to update the sequence
representation (S_input).

backpropagation. s represents the single representation, and z represents the pair representation. Loss can be backpropagated through:
(1) distogram to Pairformer to sequence, (2) Confidence module to sequence, (3) Confidence module to Pairformer. LigandMPNN is
optional. It can either redesign the sequence based on the initial BoltzDesign1-generated structure, or we can initialize the starting
amino acid logits from LigandMPNN and further optimize the sequence and structure together. (B) BoltzDesign1 is generalizable to
different biomolecules, including small molecules, DNA/RNA, metal, covalent modifications, and proteins.

To optimize a sequence, we implement a four-stage process similar to the optimization approach used in BindCraft.
1. Initially, we explore continuous sequence space using softmax(logits/temperature) with temperature = 1.0 to
optimize within distribution constraints, since starting from raw logits often generates unrealistic structures and
confidence scores.
2. After the warm-up stage, we initialize with softmax logits and transition to continuous sequence space,
where the sequence representation is calculated as (1-λ) * logits + λ * softmax(logits/temperature), with λ =
(step+1)/iterations and temperature = 1.0. This allows multiple amino acids to be considered simultaneously at
each binder position, enabling broader exploration of the sequence-structure space.
3. In the third stage, we normalize sequence logits to probabilities using the softmax function, gradually con-
verging toward a more realistic sequence representation defined as softmax(logits/temperature). The temperature
decreases with each step according to temperature = (1e-2 + (1 - 1e-2) * (1 - (step + 1) / iterations)**2), which
also scales the learning rate to decay.
4. In the final stage, we optimize in one-hot encoded sequence space while backpropagating through
the softmax representation. The one-hot encoded sequence is given by (argmax(softmax(logits)) - soft-
max(logits)).stop_gradient + softmax(logits)
5. Once we obtain the initial BoltzDesign1 generated sequences, LigandMPNN can be utilized for further
optimization. This can be done by either fixing the interface or fully redesigning the sequence given a complex
structure.

3 Results

Distogram from Pairformer captures protein and target interactions and serves as a proxy for confidence scores
Since backpropagating through the structure (which involves 3D atom coordinates) is computationally expensive, we
evaluate whether the distogram is sufficient to achieve good results for both inter- and intra-chain interactions. We first
evaluated how much contact information the Pairformer can obtain without using the structure module. We assessed
binders from the BindCraft paper by comparing the distogram contacts from Pairformer, the contacts from predicted
structures generated by the structure module, and the actual contacts from the AF2-predicted models (Figure 2A). As
shown in Figure 2B, Pairformer correctly predicts most of the designs, with 76% of designs having Precision at K(P@K)
higher than 0.5. Recycling Pairformer multiple times improves P@K up to three recycling steps, but no significant
improvement is observed with additional recycling (Figure 2C).
Next, we examined whether the contact loss from the distogram correlates with confidence scores pLDDT (predicted
local distance difference test) and inter-pAE (i-pAE, inter predicted aligned error) to determine if the distogram alone
provides sufficient information about structural confidence. We used two contact losses: inter-contact and intra-contact,
where inter-contact loss measures the contact between the target and the binder, and intra-contact loss measures contact
within the binder. We followed the standard losses from previous hallucination studies [10].
To calculate the contact loss between two residues, we minimize the entropy of low distance bins pi,j between residues
(i, j) by calculating

∑( )
pi,j = − q∗i,j,m · log(qi,j,m) (2)

m

where:

qi,j,m = {softmax(dgrami,j,m) (3)
1, if dgram_binsi,j,m < cutoff

binsi,j,m = (4)
0, otherwise

q∗i,j,m = softmax(dgrami,j,m − 107 · (1− binsi,j,m)) (5)

Distogram (dgrami,j,m) encodes the predicted probability of the distance between residues i and j falling into the
m-th distance bin. The bins are evenly spaced, ranging from 2 to 22 Å (bin index m = 1, . . . , 64). For each bin m,
dgram_binsi,j,m represents the corresponding distance range for that bin. A residue pair is considered a contact if its
predicted distance falls below a certain cutoff. For intra-contact, we use a 14 Å cutoff, and for inter-contact, we use a 22
Å cutoff.

Figure 2: Pairformer distogram effectively captures interactions between proteins and their targets, serving as a proxy for confidence
scores. (A) There are two ways of getting contacts. One is from Pairformer, by getting distogram (probability of distance between
pairwise residues), and the other is from the diffusion model by obtaining 3D coordinates. Distogram is computed through the
Pairformer with the default setting allowing 3 recycles. The sequence and pair representations from Pairformer are passed to the
diffusion model, and through 200 diffusion steps, the 3D atomic coordinates structure is achieved. Here, we show the example
of BefV1 binder 7 where contacts are correctly predicted by both Pairformer and diffusion model. (B) P@K performance on 212
successful binders across 13 protein targets from the Bindcraft paper. P@K is computed by comparing true inter-chain contacts with
predicted inter-chain contacts from Pairformer Distogram and the Structure module’s predicted structures, where K represents the
number of true inter-chain contacts (CB-CB distance < 8Å). (C) P@K performance of Pairformer Distogram contacts, comparing the
results across different recycling steps (ranging from 0 to 6). (D) Correlation between distogram contact loss and the confidence
score of designed binders. From left to right: binder intra-contact loss vs. binder pLDDT, inter-chain contact loss vs. inter-pAE. The
rows (from top to bottom) represent protein binders, small molecule binders, and nucleic acid binders. The protein targets are from
Bindcraft, while the targets for small molecules and nucleic acids are from the LigandMPNN test dataset.

To compute overall contact loss, we first compute the mean of the lowest k contact losses for each binder residue i.
For inter-contact loss, we set k = 1, meaning only the strongest contact matters. For intra-contact loss, we use k = 2,
accounting for two key contacts per binder residue. Next, we compute the overall contact loss by averaging the lowest
losses from l binder residues, where l is the length of the binder by default. Additionally, for intra-contact loss, we
ignore residue pairs where i− j < 9. This prevents the model from achieving high confidence simply by generating
helical regions, and instead encourages the modeling of long-range interactions.
By analyzing how contact loss relates to pLDDT and inter-pAE, we can determine whether contact-based metrics alone
provide enough information to evaluate structural confidence. A strong correlation would suggest that contact loss could
serve as an independent measure of protein structure reliability. We designed binders for proteins, small molecules,
and nucleic acids, comparing inter- and intra-contact loss with pLDDT and pAE scores. As shown in Figure 2D, we
observed a clear correlation between intra- and inter-contact loss and inter-pAE and inter-pLDDT scores for proteins
and small molecules. However, for nucleic acids, the correlation between inter-pAE and inter-chain contact loss is less
clear, with an R² of 0.412.
For protein-protein interactions and small molecules, distogram contact losses can serve as a proxy for confidence
scores. However, for nucleic acids, additional support from confidence losses is required due to the lower correlation
between distogram losses and confidence scores. We conclude that while the distogram is sufficient for obtaining
good contact information, the structure module is essential for accurately docking biomolecules in more complex and
intricate interactions.
BoltzDesign1 generates diverse small molecule binders with high in silico success rates
RfDiffusionAA paper presented the in silico success rate of binder design for four small molecules: IAI, FAD, SAM,
and OQO (Figure 3A). For baseline testing, we also generated binders for these ligands and redesigned them using
LigandMPNN [19] to compare our success rate with those reported in RfDiffusionAA. In addition to fully redesigning
sequences, we also explored a strategy of fixing binding interface residues within 6Å (CA) of any ligand atom while
redesigning surface residues to see whether the initial sequence designed from BoltzDesign1 can model better interfaces
than LigandMPNN redesigned interfaces.
Inter-contact loss for protein-protein interactions has previously been defined as optimizing for one contact per binder
residue (where k=1, l is the length of the binder, as explained in the Method section). However, we frequently observed
that for protein-small molecule interactions, the proteins often wrapped around the ligand, leading to high Apo-Holo
RMSD due to the maximization of protein-ligand contacts. To address this issue, we first begin optimization without the
ligand, allowing the protein to fold unconditionally. Once the secondary structures are established, we then introduce
the ligand and optimize the protein-ligand interactions. Instead of calculating loss from multiple contacts, we optimize
a single contact at each step—the one with the lowest contact loss (k=1, l=1). Although we only optimize one contact
directly, making that contact confident often requires additional supporting contacts, which are implicitly encouraged
during the process. A key distinction between BoltzDesign1 and RfDiffusionAA is that RfDiffusionAA maintains fixed
ligand conformations throughout sampling, while BoltzDesign1 adopts new conformations with each iteration.
For each ligand, we generated 30 structures with helix loss weight terms ranging from 0 to -0.3. We then redesigned the
sequences with LigandMPNN, generating 5 sequences per structure, and repredicted complex structures with AF3.
We evaluated the results based on five different criteria:

1. Structure confidence scores: pLDDT for overall complex structure confidence and ipAE for binder and small
molecule interface confidence. Success rate is defined by AF3 complex pLDDT > 0.7 and AF3 ipAE < 10
[20, 21, 22].
2. Cross-model consistency: Measured by RMSD between predicted structures from Boltz-1 and AF3 to assess
the consistency of designed binders across different models, with a success rate defined by RMSD <2 Å.
3. Self-consistency (Designable backbone): RMSD of protein structures before and after redesign with Boltz-
1/AF3 with a success rate defined as RMSD < 2 Å [23].
4. Docking score: Evaluated using Gnina [24, 25], which estimates binding affinity and pose quality for the
designed binder and target protein [26]. Docking was performed at the AF3-predicted binding site, and the CNN
VS score was calculated by multiplying the CNN affinity and pose scores. Results are compared to the wild-type
PDB and ligand to assess binding strength and pose quality.
5. Structure diversity: Measured by the average pairwise TM-score between structures generated for the same
ligand target [27].

calculated by measuring the percentage of designs passing either a strict filter (AF3 3complex pLDDT > 0.7 and AF3 ipAE < 10)
or a more relaxed filter (AF3 3complex pLDDT > 0.7 and AF3 ipAE < 15). We evaluated BoltzDesign1-generated binders under
two different conditions: (1) hallucination with both the Pairformer and the confidence module, and (2) using the Pairformer only.
In both conditions, we set recycle = 0, fixed the initial BoltzDesign1 interface residues, and redesigned the surface residues using
LigandMPNN.

helix loss weights: no helix loss, -0.2, and -0.3 helix loss. (C) Examples of designs showing an increase in sheet content as the
absolute helix loss weights increase.

As shown in Figure 3B, BoltzDesign1 successfully generated binders for four small-molecule targets. These binders
formed interactions between proteins and ligands, including hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and π-π
interactions (Figure 3C).
Both approaches—(1) Pairformer only and (2) Pairformer with Confidence hallucination—demonstrated higher AF3
success rates compared to RfDiffusionAA designs across all four ligands (Figure 3D). Additionally, using both
Pairformer and the Confidence module resulted in a higher success rate than using Pairformer alone for three out of four
ligands. We achieved the best results by setting the Pairformer recycling step to 0 and fixing the initial BoltzDesign1
sequence at the interface while redesigning the remaining surface regions using LigandMPNN.(Supplementary Figure
S2B). Even with sequences fully redesigned using LigandMPNN, we observed higher sequence recovery at the
interface, indicating it is more conserved (Supplementary Figure S1). This highlights that BoltzDesign1 can effectively
model interactions between biomolecules, compared to backbone generation models that do not explicitly consider
sequence. Furthermore, BoltzDesign1 achieved higher success rates with a recycling step of 0 compared to recycling 1
(Supplementary Figure S2A). This suggests that simpler optimization, like fixing the interface and minimizing recycling,
produces more reliable backbone and sequence designs. We reason that during multiple recycling steps, the model may
generate adversarial or suboptimal sequences that initially have low confidence, but are misleadingly boosted to higher
confidence via multiple iterations [28].
BoltzDesign1 designs show significantly higher cross-model consistency and self-consistency than RFdiffusionAA,
both for designs generated using the Pairformer and Confidence module (Supplementary Figures S3A, B) and those
generated solely by Pairformer (Supplementary Figures S4A, B). Overall, the BoltzDesign1 structures are highly
designable, showing strong agreement between the AF3 and BoltzDesign1 models. Docking scores measured by Gnina
indicate that while most designs score lower than the wild-type PDB complex and its ligand, several BoltzDesign1
designs outperform the native ligand binder—specifically, 9.3% of designs for SAM, 7.3% for OQO, and 4.0% for IAI
(Supplementary Figure S3C).
In terms of structural diversity, BoltzDesign1 outperforms RfDiffusionAA by generating more diverse designs. We
evaluated 30 designs per small molecule type without filtering (Figure 4A). BoltzDesign1 generated structures with
an average pairwise TM-score of 0.36, indicating greater diversity, while RfDiffusionAA designs were more similar
to each other, with an average TM-score of 0.46. Additionally, our analysis of secondary structure content revealed
that increasing the helix loss term for BoltzDesign1 led to higher beta sheet content (Figure 4B), as illustrated in the
example structures (Figure 4C).

BoltzDesign1 as a generalizable tool for generating binders to a wide range of biomolecules
Designing binders for biomolecules, including proteins, protein complexes, metal ions, DNA, RNA, and those covalent
modifications is crucial for biological pathways and functions [29, 30, 31, 32]. In addition to small molecules, we tested
the applicability of BoltzDesign1 to binding other biologically relevant molecules.
Metal ions are essential for enzyme catalysis, signal transduction, and protein regulation, with alkali metals facilitating
signal transduction and transition metals like zinc and iron driving enzymatic reactions [33]. As test examples, we
selected zinc and iron due to their biological significance and characteristic coordination geometries. We designed
binders using the BoltzDesign1 pipeline, redesigned resulting sequences with LigandMPNN, and predicted structures
with AF3. These were then analyzed using AllMetal3D to predict metal identity and coordination [34], ensuring that
the designs achieved high AF3 confidence scores and a high probability of correct metal identity and coordination. Our
designed zinc and iron binders exhibited the expected octahedral and tetrahedral coordination with the protein (Figure
5A,B), incorporating known iron-binding residues such as Tyr, Asp, and His [35].
Next, for nucleic acid binders, we tested B-DNA [36], the most common natural double-stranded DNA conformation.
The binders exhibit high shape complementarity with the nucleic acid, as well as expected positive charge distribution
at the interface. Additionally, we observe the formation of relevant hydrogen bonds with both the phosphate backbone
and certain base-specific interactions (Figure 5C).
Finally, we demonstrate the design of binders for detecting specific post-translational modifications in target proteins.
These covalent modifications play crucial roles in cellular signaling, protein function regulation, and disease progression
by altering protein structure, interactions, and localization. We designed binders for therapeutically important proteins
that have known phosphorylation or glycosylation sites. The first target is the phosphorylated proliferating cell nuclear
antigen (PCNA) at Tyr-211. PCNA-Y211 can promote cancer progression and development [37]. Designing binders
that target this site could help mitigate these effects. The second target is phosphorylated Smad2. The C-terminal
phosphoserine (pSer) residues of phosphorylated Smad2 induce the formation of a homotrimer, which drives cancer
progression. Targeting this phosphorylated site can prevent homotrimer formation [38]. The last target is glycosylated
CD45, chosen for its role in regulating T-cell activation, offering the potential to modulate its signaling for anti-tumor
therapies. CD45 glycosylation can influence various biological properties, including immunogenicity and specificity,
potentially hindering signaling activity [39].
To design binders for these targets, we specified constraints to define binding pocket contacts and covalent modification
positions. These constraints were then represented as an additional one-hot encoded token feature provided to the model.
As shown in Figures 5 D and E, we successfully designed binders that bind to the PCNA and Smad2 phosphorylation
sites by forming hydrogen bonds and also interacting with the target protein. Additionally, binders targeting the
glycosylation site of CD45 exhibit specific interactions with the covalently attached sugar moiety (Figure 5).

4 Conclusion

In this work, we introduce BoltzDesign1, a computational framework leveraging the Boltz-1 all-atom structure prediction
model for protein design without requiring additional fine-tuning. The principal advantage of our approach is the
elimination of backpropagation through the computationally expensive diffusion module, significantly reducing resource
requirements while maintaining design quality.
Our results demonstrate several significant advances in protein design. First, BoltzDesign1 achieves higher in silico
success rates, as measured by AlphaFold3, and generates more diverse structures than RfDiffusionAA. Hallucinating
through Pairformer and Confidence module without any recycling steps achieves the best in silico success rate, possibly
due to the removal of adversarial and difficult structures that would otherwise require multiple recycling steps for
accurate prediction. Second, unlike previous approaches that use fixed ligand conformations, BoltzDesign1 adopts new
conformations with each iteration, providing a more flexible framework for complex ligand-protein interactions.
The distogram from Pairformer effectively captures biomolecular interactions and serves as a reliable proxy for
confidence scores, allowing us to bypass the computational expense of backpropagating through the structure module
while maintaining high design quality. Our strategy of fixing the initial BoltzDesign1-generated sequence at the interface
residues while redesigning the surface residues resulted in higher success rates compared to redesigning the entire
structure. This underscores the strength of BoltzDesign1 in simultaneously modeling both the structure and sequence
at the binding interface. Thus, hotspot conditioning method allows targeted design of binding interfaces, improving
specificity and functional performance.
Despite its promising results, BoltzDesign1 has some limitations. It does not currently use templates as input, which
could be helpful for guiding the design of structures with high uncertainty or providing constraints for target structures.

10








Additionally, the model lacks integration of nucleic acid MSAs, limiting its ability to effectively design protein-
DNA/RNA interactions. Another challenge is the potential for overfitting by using a single model for both design and
prediction, which could introduce bias and reduce generalizability, particularly for complex targets or new, unseen
structures.
Future work will focus on developing more stable optimization methods tailored to target characteristics and imple-
menting joint optimization between sequence design and structure prediction models. Furthermore, we plan to conduct
experimental validation of our computational designs and extend our approach to more challenging targets, including
those with high flexibility, such as flexible DNA and RNA, as well as targets with multiple covalent modifications
and binders that selectively bind to these modifications. These advances mark a significant step toward generalizable
biomolecular design approaches, with potential applications in drug discovery, enzyme engineering, and molecular
diagnostics.
